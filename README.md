Software Management Tool
Software Management Tool This is the initial project phase for the Software Management Tool. 
The purpose of the Software Management Tool is to help software development teams plan, manage, 
track and status their projects. This initial phase will lay down the foundation framework to 
include the beginnings of tracking an Agile Scrum project. As new features are added during 
the project the team will begin using them to track this project itself. We plan to use the 
Software Management Tool to manage user stories in a project backlog, plan and manage sprints, 
and provide project status.
