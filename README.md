Software Management Tool
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the initial project phase for the Software Management Tool. 
The purpose of the Software Management Tool is to help software development 
teams plan, manage, track and status their projects. This initial phase will lay down 
the foundation framework to include the beginnings of tracking an Agile Scrum project. 
As new features are added during the project the team will begin using them to track this project itself.
We plan to use the Software Management Tool to manage user stories in a project backlog, plan and 
manage sprints, and provide project status.
